# Theo Chocolate Factory Tour

Seattle: While wandering through Fremont, WA, I caught the unmistakable scent of chocolate...

At first I though I was just smelling the chocolate mulch that gardeners sometimes use, but then my friend Kipp told me that we were in fact right by the Theo Chocolate factory itself.

Armed with this knowledge, I set out on a tour to see how this heavenly chocolate was made, and to taste the free samples myself.

Here are some photos from the tour:

Theo is first organic and fair trade chocolate company in the US. Also the first 'Bean to Bar' company in the US. Now, there are over 50 of these types of companies, which handle the entire process, from farming to sales, but originally it was a pretty big deal.

60% of the world's chocolate comes from sources that are not considered fair trade, oftentimes meaning that they are the result of forces child labor. Theo makes sure that each chocolate farmer has access to education, health services, and fair, livable wages.

The name 'Theo' comes from the name of the active ingredient in chocolate, which is Theobroddd, sort of like what THC is to weed.

Most Theo chocolate bars hover at around 70% cacao. Anything over 65% is considered a health food by the FDA. My personal preference is for chocolates right around this level, from 55% to 85%.

Two sources, the Congo in Africa and Peru in South America. Chocolate from Peru arrives in about 2-3 weeks, whereas chocolate from the Congo takes about 6 months, surprisingly.

Hershey's chocolate only has 12% cacao, whereas even the milk chocolate that Theo makes has about 45% cacao. In other words, Hershey's is mostly butter and sugar and not much cacao.

Typically, the Theo factory produces 15,000 chocolate bars per day. Quite a lot!

At the end of the tour, we we're given 10% off store prices, which were really like 50% of what I pay for Theo chocolate at Whole Foods in LA.

I stocked up on the "Library" pack, as well as a coffee chocolate bar, and several chocolate ganache treats that can't be bought anywhere else in the world, since they only have a shelf life of three days.

All in all, amazing tour! Can't wait to dig into this chocolate üòã !! I was even able to catch a glimpse of "Willy Wonka" himself! Tried to be lowkey when I snapped a photo üòÅ.
