# Theo Chocolate Factory Tour

Seattle: While wandering through Fremont, Washington, I caught the unmistakable scent of chocolate...

At first I though I was just smelling the chocolate mulch that gardeners sometimes use, but then my friend Kipp told me that we were in fact right by the Theo Chocolate factory itself.

Armed with this knowledge, I set out on a tour to see how this heavenly chocolate was made, and to taste the free samples myself. 

Stay tuned for photos!
